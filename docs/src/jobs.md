This position requires strong technical skills, sharp communication, continuous learning spikes for new technologies and
adapting to new practices.

#### Home Owners Association

Worked in a large scale operation series of micro-frontends that integrates/refactors legacy functionalities into a
modern web-based ecosystem.
Primarily as an **Angular** developer using **Angular Elements, NgRx, Nrwl Nx, AG-Grid, functional unit testing and
more**. I also gained some experience using **.Net Entity framework**.

skills on an **Agile team environment** as well as coordinating efforts and solving dependencies with third-parties.

modules I worked on this project were the landing page, rewards profile, forms, sliders, paginated offer catalog,
modals, interstitial pages, email templates and gadgets with dynamic data among others.

#### R&D - Gorilla Labs

I researched the benefits and limitations of building PWA’s and _when_ these should be considered over native
development. I wrote a blog about this topic which can be found
[here](https://gorillalogic.com/blog/why-and-when-you-should-consider-using-pwas/).
