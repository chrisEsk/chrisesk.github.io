## Introduction

As a pragmatic leader in software engineering, I've gained diverse experience across consulting, development, teaching, QA, DevOps, entrepreneurship and project management.

I'm dedicated to continuous learning, exploring new technologies, and embracing experimentation.

I firmly believe that excellence stems from genuine passion for one's work, which has been a driving force since discovering my interest for software and technology early in life.
