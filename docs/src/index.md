### Introduction

I'm a pragmatic leader, detail oriented professional with experience in <strong>e-commerce, crowdfunding platforms, home
owner associations, QA, DevOps, entrepreneurship and project management</strong>. I specialize in software engineering development, both technical and process side.

I’ve worked with various technologies and tools for the development of hybrid apps.
I enjoy working in a team environment and learning from others, as well as sharing my knowledge.

I am a proactive person that's constantly experimenting with new tech, I like to explore uncharted territories and learn
by <strong>doing</strong>. A good example of this is a Chromecast application I developed where I had to self-taught how
to develop such app.

**I believe excellence can only be achieved if you're passionate about what you're doing. This is something users can
tell when using your solutions; I am grateful to say that I found my passion for software and technology early in
life.**
