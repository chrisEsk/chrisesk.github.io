## Introduction

I'm a pragmatic leader and detail-oriented professional with experience in a diverse background of software engineering, <strong>including consulting, development, teaching, QA, DevOps, entrepreneurship, and project management</strong>. I specialize in both technical and process sides.

I've worked with an extensive list of technologies and tools that have allowed me to reach a level of software architect, tech lead, and designer for various Fortune 500 clients since 2016.

I am a proactive person who is constantly experimenting with new tech. I like to explore uncharted territories and learn by doing. My colleagues praise me for being a very fast learner, regardless of the tech ecosystem.

I believe excellence can only be achieved when you're passionate about what you're doing. This is something users can discern when using your solutions. I am grateful to say that I discovered my passion for software and technology early in life.
