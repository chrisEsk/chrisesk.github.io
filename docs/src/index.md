## Introduction

I'm a pragmatic leader, detail oriented professional with experience in a diverse background of software engineering, including <strong>consulting, development, teaching, QA, DevOps, entrepreneurship and project management</strong>. I specialize in both technical and process side.

I’ve worked with an extensive list of technologies and tools that have allowed me to reach a level of software architect, tech lead and designer for various Fortune 500 clients since 2016.

I am a proactive person that's constantly experimenting with new tech, I like to explore uncharted territories and learn
by <strong>doing</strong>. My colleagues praise me for being an very fast learner, regardless of the tech ecosystem.

**I believe excellence can only be achieved if you're passionate about what you're doing. This is something users can
tell when using your solutions; I am grateful to say that I found my passion for software and technology early in
life.**
